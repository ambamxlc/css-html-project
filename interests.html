    <h1 style="color:black;">What Do I Care About? South Park</h1>
    <p>I like cartoons and my favorite one is South Park. I remember seeing it on TV as a kid, but I wasn't allowed to watch it then. I was told it was a "bad" show. Then at the end of 2021 I was introduced to HBO Max, and on HBO Max were all the seasons of South Park. I was looking for something to watch so I decided to give it a try. I never looked back. One of my favorite characters on the show is Eric Cartman. He's definitely the start of the show and South Park's #1 jerk. He's mean to his mom, his friends, and everyone else he encounters. He only cares about upward mobility for himself and nothing else. He's intolerant towards hippies and likes to eat the skin off of fried chicken and not share with his friends. Despite this, everyone who watches the show loves him <3.</p>
    <h2>Quote from South Park</h2>
   
    <p>"In 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,' a bunch of hippies walk around and paint stuff. <br> They eat lunch, and then they find a magical camel, which they have to eat to stay alive. <br> And that's pretty much it. I give it a B-minus. <br> -Eric Cartman" </p>
