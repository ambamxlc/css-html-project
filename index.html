        <p style="color:white;">My name is Amber Cruz and I was born in Houston, Texas. After graduating from high school I moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina where I attended Salem College for 4 years and ultimately graduated with a degree in English. Upon graduation I then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania because I had visited the summer before and really liked it and wanted to move there. While in Philadelphia I worked in the tech field for 3 years and was exposed to the ins and outs of working for a software company. Although the job was cool, I was not completely ready to pursue this career long term and so I made a career switch into clinical research in hopes of then pivoting into a nursing career. After 6 months at the research job I realized the medical field was not for me. So I began working towards applying for the WIN Program. I was eventually accepted, and after one year of working in research I submitted my resignation letter and packed my bags to move down to Charlotte, North Carolina where I then began my journey into learning to code and collaborate in a professional setting.</p>
        <p style="color:white;">I have only been with the WIN Program for 17 days so far, but in this short time I have learned a lot about many topics such as: Command Line, Git, the basics of makign web pages, formatting with HTML, styling with CSS, and most recently we've started to learn about Frameworks like Bootstrap. In these few weeks we've completed various assignments and tasks that have been used to teach us to code and collaborate. In this portfolio I would like to share a timeline of my journey, including the assignment milestones I've been able to complete so far.</p>
